# Superstore-Database
A command line tool simulating a superstore. Really just MySQL practice.

## How To Use
Set up a dotenv file with the following format:
```
# Password

MYSQL_DB_PW=YOUR PASSWORD HERE
```

Make sure your MySQL database is live and has been set up according to the schema given. Feel free to add the seed values given or create your own.

There are three ways of interacting with the database: as a `customer`, a `manager`, or a `supervisor`. Those are also the three node CLIs you can run. Follow along with the prompts and enjoy this Superstore Sandbox.

## Project History 
This project was a homework assignment for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, testing our ability to use MySQL databases and to interact with them via Node.js
